# This workflow lets you manually create snapshot relases
#
# A snapshot release is useful when you want to try out changes on a pull request
# before making a full release and without making a pre release mode.
#
# Problem
#
# This is useful as changesets force pre release mode across all packages in our
# mono repo. When using pre releases then stable releases of all packages are
# blocked until pre release is exited.
#
# What are snapshot releases
#
# To work around this issue we have this workflow. It lets you create a
# once-off release for a specific branch. We call those snapshot releases.
# Snapshot releases are published under the `snapshot` dist-tag and have
# versions like 0.4.0-579bd13f016c7de43a2830340634b3948db358b6-20230913164912,
# which consist of the version that would be generated, the commit hash and
# the timestamp.
#
# How to create a snapshot release
#
# Make sure you have a branch pushed to GitHub, and make sure that branch has
# a changeset committed. You can generate a changeset with "pnpm changeset".
#
# Then open github.com/vercel/storage and click on Actions > Release Snapshot
# Then click "Run workflow" on the right and select the branch you want to
# create a snapshot release for and click the "Run workflow" button.
#
# Then wait for the run to kick off and open the details.
# Find the "Create Snapshot Release" step in the logs.
# The last line of that log should contain something like
#   🦋  success packages published successfully:
#   🦋  @vercel/edge-config@0.4.0-579bd13f016c7de43a2830340634b3948db358b6-20230913164912
# This shows the version which was generated.
