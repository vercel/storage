# @vercel/blob

## 0.27.2

### Patch Changes

- 54ce5f8: Allow all special characters to be used as pathname.
  You can now use all the characters you want in pathname even the ones that have
  special meaning in urls like `%!'()@{}[]#` and it will work as expected.

## 0.27.1

### Patch Changes

- 0c98feb: fix(blob): allow client uploads in web workers

  Before this change, we had guards so client uploads could only be used in
  browser environments, this prevented customers to use Vercel Blob in Web
  Workers, sometimes React Native or in general anywhere window is not really what
  we think it is.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 7872e61: contentType default is now 'application/octet-stream' instead of `undefined`

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- c3afec3: Add onUploadProgress feature to put/upload

  You can now track the upload progress in Node.js and all major browsers when
  using put/upload in multipart, non-multipart and client upload modes. Basically
  anywhere in our API you can upload a file, then you can follow the upload
  progress.

  Here's a basic usage example:

  ```
  const blob = await put('big-file.pdf', file, {
    access: 'public',
    onUploadProgress(event) {
      console.log(event.loaded, event.total, event.percentage);
    }
  });
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 261319e: # Add abortSignal

  Adds `abortSignal` option to all methods. This allows users to cancel requests using an AbortController and passing its signal to the operation.

  Here's how to use it:

  ```ts
  const abortController = new AbortController();

  vercelBlob
    .put('canceled.txt', 'test', {
      access: 'public',
      abortSignal: abortController.signal,
    })
    .then((blob) => {
      console.log('Blob created:', blob);
    });

  setTimeout(function () {
    // Abort the upload
    abortController.abort();
  }, 100);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 13988ed: BREAKING CHANGE: The `contentType` field of the PutBlobResult is now optional which might break TS builds. This aligns the SDK typings with the actual Response of the Blob API.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a5c52: fix(blob): correctly handle Node.js buffers as input

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 52c2fe2: feat(blob): add rate limited error

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e278f2: # feat(blob): add advanced multipart upload methods

  This exposes the three different multipart steps as functions of the SDK. Before this change every multipart upload was uncontrolled, meaning the full data was passed to the SDK and the SDK took care of chunking and uploading.

  Now it's possible to manually upload chunks and start and complete the multipart upload. All of the new functions can be used both on the server and the browser. There are two different API's that can be used.

  All parts uploaded must be at least 5MB in size, except for the last part. The last part can be smaller than 5MB. If you have a single part, it can be any size. All parts must be the same size, except for the last part.

  ## Individual methods

  Use `createMultipartUpload`, `uploadPart` and `completeMultipartUpload` to manage the upload.

  ```ts
  const { key, uploadId } = await vercelBlob.createMultipartUpload(
    'big-file.txt',
    { access: 'public' },
  );

  const part1 = await vercelBlob.uploadPart(fullPath, 'first part', {
    access: 'public',
    key,
    uploadId,
    partNumber: 1,
  });

  const part2 = await vercelBlob.uploadPart(fullPath, 'second part', {
    access: 'public',
    key,
    uploadId,
    partNumber: 2,
  });

  const blob = await vercelBlob.completeMultipartUpload(
    fullPath,
    [part1, part2],
    {
      access: 'public',
      key,
      uploadId,
    },
  );
  ```

  ## Multipart uploader

  For multipart methods, since some of the data remains consistent (uploadId, key), you can make use of the `createMultipartUploader`. This function stores certain data internally, making it possible to offer convinient `put` and `complete` functions.

  ```ts
  const uploader = await vercelBlob.createMultipartUploader('big-file.txt', {
    access: 'public',
  });

  const part1 = await uploader.uploadPart(1, createReadStream(fullPath));

  const part2 = await uploader.uploadPart(2, createReadStream(fullPath));

  const blob = await uploader.complete([part1, part2]);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 2ecc0e2: fix(blob): remove multipart boolean from copy options

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d71dda: # feat(blob): add `downloadUrl` and `getDownloadUrl`

  Adds a new blob property called `downloadUrl`. This URL will have the `content-disposition` set to `attachment` meaning it will force browsers to start a download instead of showing a preview. This URL can be used to implement download links. In addition to this new field the sdk is also exposing a new util function called `getDownloadUrl` which can also be used to derive a download URL from a blob URL.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- d44bd3b: feat(blob): add retry to all blob requests

  This change generalizes the way we request the internal Blob API. This moves api version, authorization, response validation and error handling all into one place.
  Also this adds a retry mechanism to the API requests

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- dc7ba0e: feat(blob): allow inline content disposition for certain blobs

  Once you use this new version, then most common medias won't be automatically
  downloading but rather will display the content inline.

  Already uploaded files will not change their behavior.
  You can reupload them if you want to change their behavior.

  Fixes #509

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- d4c06b0: chore(blob): fix types on client.put

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 898c14a: feat(blob): Add multipart option to reliably upload medium and large files

  It turns out, uploading large files using Vercel Blob has been a struggle for users.
  Before this change, file uploads were limited to around 200MB for technical reasons.
  Before this change, even uploading a file of 100MB could fail for various reasons (network being one of them).

  To solve this for good, we're introducting a new option to `put` and `upload` calls: `multipart: true`. This new option will make sure your file is uploaded parts by parts to Vercel Blob, and when some parts are failing, we will retry them. This option is available for server and client uploads.

  Usage:

  ```ts
  const blob = await put('file.png', file, {
    access: 'public',
    multipart: true, // `false` by default
  });

  // and:
  const blob = await upload('file.png', file, {
    access: 'public',
    handleUploadUrl: '/api/upload',
    multipart: true,
  });
  ```

  If your `file` is a Node.js stream or a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) then we will gradually read and upload it without blowing out your server or browser memory.

  More examples:

  ```ts
  import { createReadStream } from 'node:fs';

  const blob = await vercelBlob.put(
    'elon.mp4',
    // this works üëç, it will gradually read the file from the system and upload it
    createReadStream('/users/Elon/me.mp4'),
    { access: 'public', multipart: true },
  );
  ```

  ```ts
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://example-files.online-convert.com/video/mp4/example_big.mp4',
  );

  const blob = await vercelBlob.put(
    'example_big.mp4',
    // this works too üëç, it will gradually read the file from internet and upload it
    response.body,
    { access: 'public', multipart: true },
  );
  ```

### Patch Changes

- fd1781f: feat(blob): allow folder creation

  This allows the creation of empty folders in the blob store. Before this change the SDK would always require a body, which is prohibited by the API.
  Now the the SDK validates if the operation is a folder creation by checking if the pathname ends with a trailling slash.

  ```ts
  const blob = await vercelBlob.put('folder/', {
    access: 'public',
    addRandomSuffix: false,
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- f9c4061: fix(blob): Enforce content-type on fetch requests during token generation

  Before this change, we would not send the content-type header on fetch requests sent to your server during client uploads. We consider this a bugfix as it should have been sent before.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è If you upgrade to this version, and you're using any smart request body parser (like Next.js Pages API routes) then: You need to remove any `JSON.parse(request.body)` at the `handleUpload` step, as the body will be JSON by default now. This is valid for the `onBeforeGenerateToken` and `onUploadCompleted` steps.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- d57df99: Adds a new `mode: folded | expanded (default)` parameter to the list command options. When you pass `folded` to `mode`, then we automatically fold all files belonging to the same folder into a single folder entry. This allows you to build file browsers using the Vercel Blob API.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 8251462: This release introduces BREAKING CHANGES. Mostly, we've separated client and server needs better. While ensuring we only export what we currently think is useful to you.

  We have a completely new documentation about client (browser) uploads: https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob/client-upload.

  We've moved and renamed client-related utilities, including the ones to generate client tokens, to a separate entry file: `@vercel/blob/client`. Use it this way:

  ```ts
  import {
    upload,
    handleUpload,
    generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken,
  } from '@vercel/blob/client';
  ```

  Here are the new features:

  - You can now pass a `clientPayload?: string` option during client uploads via the `upload` method. This payload can be used to attach metadata to your file, for example when updating a blog post cover image, you may want to pass: `clientPayload: JSON.stringify({ postId: 123 })`, so you can then use it server side to update the blog post.

  Here are the BREAKING CHANGES:

  - `handleBlobUpload` has moved to client/`handleUpload`
  - For client (browser) uploads, please use client/`upload` instead of `put`. Also, the `handleBlobUploadUrl` option has been renamed to `handleUploadUrl`.
  - `verifyCallbackSignature` is no more exported if you think you need it, open an issue
  - `BlobCommandOptions` type is no longer exported. This is an internal utility type. Other internal types were removed also but nobody was using them
  - `metadata` in `onBeforeGenerateToken` and `onUploadCompleted` has been renamed to `tokenPayload`

  Enjoy!

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b409aad: We added two new options on `put()`:

  - `addRandomSuffix: boolean`: Allows to disable or enable (default) random
    suffixes added to file paths
  - `cacheControlMaxAge: number`: Allows to configure the browser and edge cache,
    in seconds. Default to one year (browser) and 5 minutes (edge). The edge cache
    is currently always set to a maximum of 5 minutes. But can be lowered to 0

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- e273673: BREAKING CHANGE: Some methods responses and types have been updated following a
  migration Vercel did to make Vercel Blob more robust and closer to the S3 API.

  Namely:

  - the urls generated by Vercel Blob have moved from:
    `public.blob.vercel-storage.com/zyzoioy8txfs14xe/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
    to
    `zyzoioy8txfs14xe.blob.vercel-storage.com/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
    This change has been done transparently: all previous blob urls are
    redirected to the new domain.
  - `.put()` no more sends back size and uploadedAt, use .head() to get this
    information. Refer to the PutBlobResult type.
  - `.list()` no more sends back contentType and contentDisposition on the
    blobs property. Refer to the ListBlobResult type.
  - `.del()` doesn't return any value (void). If the file was here prior to
    a del() call, then it's now deleted.
  - `BlobResult` type has been splitted to `PutBlobResult` for put() and
    `HeadBlobResult` for head(). Use them accordingly.

  We've reworked our README to better surface the browser-upload and
  server-upload methods.
