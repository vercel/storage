# @vercel/blob

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 26a2acb: feat(blob): throw specific error when service unavailable

## 0.15.1

### Patch Changes

- f9c4061: fix(blob): Enforce content-type on fetch requests during token generation

  Before this change, we would not send the content-type header on fetch requests sent to your server during client uploads. We consider this a bugfix as it should have been sent before.

  ⚠️ If you upgrade to this version, and you're using any smart request body parser (like Next.js Pages API routes) then: You need to remove any `JSON.parse(request.body)` at the `handleUpload` step, as the body will be JSON by default now. This is valid for the `onBeforeGenerateToken` and `onUploadCompleted` steps.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- d57df99: Adds a new `mode: folded | expanded (default)` parameter to the list command options. When you pass `folded` to `mode`, then we automatically fold all files belonging to the same folder into a single folder entry. This allows you to build file browsers using the Vercel Blob API.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 8251462: This release introduces BREAKING CHANGES. Mostly, we've separated client and server needs better. While ensuring we only export what we currently think is useful to you.

  We have a completely new documentation about client (browser) uploads: https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/quickstart#client-uploads.

  We've moved and renamed client-related utilities, including the ones to generate client tokens, to a separate entry file: `@vercel/blob/client`. Use it this way:

  ```ts
  import {
    upload,
    handleUpload,
    generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken,
  } from '@vercel/blob/client';
  ```

  Here are the new features:

  - You can now pass a `clientPayload?: string` option during client uploads via the `upload` method. This payload can be used to attach metadata to your file, for example when updating a blog post cover image, you may want to pass: `clientPayload: JSON.stringify({ postId: 123 })`, so you can then use it server side to update the blog post.

  Here are the BREAKING CHANGES:

  - `handleBlobUpload` has moved to client/`handleUpload`
  - For client (browser) uploads, please use client/`upload` instead of `put`. Also, the `handleBlobUploadUrl` option has been renamed to `handleUploadUrl`.
  - `verifyCallbackSignature` is no more exported if you think you need it, open an issue
  - `BlobCommandOptions` type is no longer exported. This is an internal utility type. Other internal types were removed also but nobody was using them
  - `metadata` in `onBeforeGenerateToken` and `onUploadCompleted` has been renamed to `tokenPayload`

  Enjoy!

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b409aad: We added two new options on `put()`:

  - `addRandomSuffix: boolean`: Allows to disable or enable (default) random
    suffixes added to file paths
  - `cacheControlMaxAge: number`: Allows to configure the browser and edge cache,
    in seconds. Default to one year (browser) and 5 minutes (edge). The edge cache
    is currently always set to a maximum of 5 minutes. But can be lowered to 0

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- e273673: BREAKING CHANGE: Some methods responses and types have been updated following a
  migration Vercel did to make Vercel Blob more robust and closer to the S3 API.

  Namely:

  - the urls generated by Vercel Blob have moved from:
    `public.blob.vercel-storage.com/zyzoioy8txfs14xe/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
    to
    `zyzoioy8txfs14xe.blob.vercel-storage.com/somefile-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt`
    This change has been done transparently: all previous blob urls are
    redirected to the new domain.
  - `.put()` no more sends back size and uploadedAt, use .head() to get this
    information. Refer to the PutBlobResult type.
  - `.list()` no more sends back contentType and contentDisposition on the
    blobs property. Refer to the ListBlobResult type.
  - `.del()` doesn't return any value (void). If the file was here prior to
    a del() call, then it's now deleted.
  - `BlobResult` type has been splitted to `PutBlobResult` for put() and
    `HeadBlobResult` for head(). Use them accordingly.

  We've reworked our README to better surface the browser-upload and
  server-upload methods.
