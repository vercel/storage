/**
 * Uploads a blob into your store from your server.
 * Detailed documentation can be found here: https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob/using-blob-sdk#upload-a-blob
 *
 * If you want to upload from the browser directly, or if you're hitting Vercel upload limits, check out the documentation for client uploads: https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob/using-blob-sdk#client-uploads
 *
 * @param pathname - The pathname to upload the blob to, including the extension. This will influence the URL of your blob like https://$storeId.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/$pathname.
 * @param body - The content of your blob, can be a: string, File, Blob, Buffer or Stream. We support almost everything fetch supports: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#body.
 * @param options - Configuration options including:
 *   - access - (Required) Must be 'public' as blobs are publicly accessible.
 *   - addRandomSuffix - (Optional) A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to false. We recommend using this option to ensure there are no conflicts in your blob filenames.
 *   - allowOverwrite - (Optional) A boolean to allow overwriting blobs. By default an error will be thrown if you try to overwrite a blob by using the same pathname for multiple blobs.
 *   - contentType - (Optional) A string indicating the media type. By default, it's extracted from the pathname's extension.
 *   - cacheControlMaxAge - (Optional) A number in seconds to configure how long Blobs are cached. Defaults to one month. Cannot be set to a value lower than 1 minute.
 *   - token - (Optional) A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel.
 *   - multipart - (Optional) Whether to use multipart upload for large files. It will split the file into multiple parts, upload them in parallel and retry failed parts.
 *   - abortSignal - (Optional) AbortSignal to cancel the operation.
 *   - onUploadProgress - (Optional) Callback to track upload progress: onUploadProgress(\{loaded: number, total: number, percentage: number\})
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the blob information, including pathname, contentType, contentDisposition, url, and downloadUrl.
